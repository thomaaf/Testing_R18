## DVA.tcl  --  Direct Variable Access
## CarMaker 6.0 ScriptControl Example - IPG Automotive GmbH (www.ipg-automotive.com)
##
## This example shows how to set the value of a variable using DVA.
## The functions introduced are:
##
## DVAWrite <Name> <Value> <Count> <Mode>
##    <Name>   - Quantity name   
##    <Value>  - New Quantity Value
##    <Count>  - Number of Cycles ... default 1 
##    <Mode>   - (0 = value, 1 = offset, 2 = factor) ... default 0
##    Sets the value of the named quantity using DVA.
##
## DVAReleaseQuants 
##    Releases the quantities from DVA control. The quantity value
##    not reset, and unless it is modified by some internal function,
##    it will keep the value it was given.

#=======================================================================
# release the quantity from DVA control. The value will not change, 
# since load is not normally modified internally by CarMaker. However, 
# it is possible to change the load back to its original value by calling
# DVAWrite again, using the original value as the new value.
